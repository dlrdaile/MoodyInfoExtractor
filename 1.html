<title>moody's confirms b3 sub debt rating of pamida but maintains negative rating outlook</title>


new york, 01-09-95 -- moody's investor's service confirmed its b3 rating on the senior subordinated notes of pamida, inc., but maintained its negative rating outlook.  the confirmation reflects pamida's positive trend in both total and same store sales growth, its progress in improving its gross margins, its limited debt maturities over the next five years,and its position as the dominant discount retailer in many of its markets.  however,  moody's remains concerned about the company's weak balance sheet, its regional concentration and dependence on largely rural economies, the threat of better capitalized mass merchandisers entering its market, the build-up in inventories, and the pressure on its cash flow from its new store expansion program.
<br>    continued favorable economic conditions throughout the company's midwest trade area, the opening of new stores, the recent realignments in its merchandise mix, and improved operating strategies, should allow pamida to continue to record positive sales growth.  during the five weeks ended january 1, 1995, pamida's sales increased 17.7% on a 9% increase in comparable stores sales.  the company is now in its sixth quarter of consecutive quarterly comparable store sales increases.
<br>    despite the continued pressure on discount retailers' gross margins, moody's believes that pamida's gross margins should stabilize somewhat due to a realignment in the company's merchandise mix which now emphasizes more higher margin products.  its stronger focus on hardlines, in contrast to the soft goods focus of some other regional discounters, also makes the company less vulnerable to unfavorable weather conditions or disappointing fashion trends.  soft lines, such as women's and men's apparel and footwear, represented about 23.7% of total sales during fiscal 1994.  although the company expects no significant new competitive store openings, margins could come again under renewed pressure if larger and better capitalized mass merchandisers were to encroach upon the company's traditional small community trade area.  today, pamida remains the sole discount retailer in at least 65% of its markets.
<br>    nowithstanding the positive development in gross margins, moody's expects operating margins to remain under pressure as a result of costs associated with the company's new store expansion program.  however, operating expenses will continue to compare favorably with other regional discount operators.
<br>    despite the favorable trend in sales, moody's expects pamida's leverage to remain high as all future excess cash flows will be devoted to the company's store expansion program. total debt over ebitda was 4.96 times for the 12 months ended july 31, 1994, whereas lease adjusted debt over lease adjusted capital was 96% for the year ended january 31, 1994.   the company plans to open between 10 and 12 stores over the next few years with capital expenditures totaling approximately $7 million annually.  further weakening the company's balance sheet could be a potential re-evaluation of some assets related to the company's 1986 lbo.
<br>    moody's is also concerned about pamida's increased investment in inventories, which are now to a larger extent funded through vendor financing.  for the twelve months ended july 31, 1994, vendors financed 52% of the company's inventories compared to 42.8% during the same period last year.  while this increased level of vendor financing underscores the vendor's confidence in the company, it also makes it more dependent on their continued support.    in order to facilitate its growth plans, moody's expects pamida to seek an enlargement of its current $60 million secured bank credit facility.  on october 30, 1994, the peak of its seasonal borrowings requirements, the company had $6.3 million of availability capacity. mandatory debt amortization is limited over the next five years as the company needs to make only approximately $2 million in long-term debt payments, other than payments under its revolving credit facility.    although moody's expects pamida's trade area to see further economic growth in 1995, the company remains dependent to a large extent on the performance of the rural economies due to its regional concentration in the midwest.
<br>    pamida, inc., based in omaha, nebraska, operates 184 general merchandise stores in small communities located in 15 midwestern, north central and rocky mountain states.
